# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I wanted to create a single webpage where I could easily write, organise and access my notes for the prework modules I completed before starting my bootcamp. This webpage provides an easy access point for my notes which I can update as I learn more about HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. Throughout creating this webpage I learnt how to structure a webpage using HTML, how to style it using an external CSS style sheet and then added functionality with JavaScript. Through completing all of these steps I also became familiar with the Git workflow.

## Usage

The webpage splits my notes into four main sections: HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. Under each heading my notes are listed as bullet points, explaining some key commands and vocabulary that I picked up over the prework lessons. Opening the console will allow you to view the JavaScript functionality that was added to the page. It lists the topics that we covered during the prework modules and then chooses a random topic for us to study at the end!
